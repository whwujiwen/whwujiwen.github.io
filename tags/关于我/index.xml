      <description>History 这是about页面
This theme began it&amp;rsquo;s life in early 2013, as the theme for my blog &amp;ldquo;Thoughts on Engineering and Management&amp;quot;. Back then it was generated using nanoc. In 2018, I moved to hugo because of it&amp;rsquo;s ability to hot-reload the website while I was working. Nanoc forced me to rebuild the site which took roughly 10-20 seconds, which quickly became a deal breaker.
Principles I have always believed in using as little computing resources as possible.</description>
